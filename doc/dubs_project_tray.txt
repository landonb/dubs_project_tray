1. About This Plugin					*dubs-prjtray-about*

A simple wrapper around the Project plugin.

  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69

Additional features:

- Toggle the project tray easily with <Alt-Shift-4>.
  The key combo was chosen to integrate nicely with
  Dubs Vim, at
    http://github.com/landonb/dubs-vim

- Put your '.vimprojects' file anywhere in your Vim
  folder and it'll be located.

- Watch window sizes be fixed after hiding the tray.

- Enjoy a few small usability tweaks to the original
  Project plugin. What tweaks? Spoilers!

2. Project Tray Commands			*dubs-prjtray-commands*

				*<Shift-Alt-4>_* *<Alt-Shift-4>_* *<M-$>_* *<S-M-4>_* *<S-A-4>_*
<Shift-Alt-4>		Toggle Project tray.
			Use \c command in project tray to
			add projects; <F5> to refresh.
                        More hints in :help project.

Details~

Type <Shift-Alt-4> once to open the project tray.
Type again to close the project tray. Repeat.

This project includes a starter '.vimprojects'
file. When you open the project tray, you'll see
some comments at the top of the file. Read them.

tl;dr, in command mode, type \c and answer two
questions -- give your new project a name, and then
enter its absolute path -- and project will create
a new project for you.

Hints: If you have two or more projects and would like
to reorder them, rather than selecting, copying and
pasting, there's an easier way. First, collapse all
directories by typing zM, and then move the cursor
on to the same line as the collapsed project you want
to move. Finally, type <Ctrl-Up> and <Ctrl-Down> to
swap the whole project with the line above or the line
below; press the key combo multiple times to move the
project to a new position.

3. Brackets in Directory Names			*dubs-prjtray-brackets*

Bug: There's an issue handling directories with
brackets in their names, such as those used in a
cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter
which uses the Jinja template engine http://jinja.pocoo.org/
which uses brackets, e.g., `cc-pyproject/{{project_name}}`.

Specifically, folding doesn't work well. If the fold
name is shorter than the project window width, e.g.,

    ex={{example}} {

then the built-in `za` command works (which toggles
folding), albeit not until after typing it at least
three times. But if the name is wider than the project
window, e.g.,

    long_{{example}}={{exammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmple}} {

so the text is clipped by the Vim window, using `za`
changes the name of the fold, e.g., from

    long_{{example}}={{exammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmple}} {

to

       long_{example}}------

(with leading spaces, too)
but doesn't collapse the directory listing.

I wouldn't normally note a bug in a readme but this
problem seems inherent to Vim and is something I'll
probably never fix.
