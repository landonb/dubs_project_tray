" 'isfname' string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
" 			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
" 			    for AMIGA: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:"
" 			    for VMS: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,<,>,[,],:,;,~"
" 			    for OS/390: "@,240-249,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,="
" 			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")

" Linux is the "otherwise" default, to which we'll add leafy brackets.
"
" 2018-08-09: See comments in plugin/dubs_project.vim's substitute(fnames, ...)
"   which uses the regex character class for file characters, ``\f``.
"   To prevent project from splitting filenames on special characters,
"   like parentheses, and exclamation marks, include them here.

" 2018-08-09: Up until now:
"   set isfname=@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=,{,}
" 2018-08-09: Adds parentheses, and bang. And single quote... and double quote.
"   (Also, is the triple comma, `,,,`, so that files with commas in their
"   names are recognized properly?)
" 2018-08-09: On second thought, including double quote messes up loading
"   .trustme.vim from within a project with a plus sign `+` in the path.
"   This I cannot explain.
"     set isfname=@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=,{,},(,),!,\',\"
