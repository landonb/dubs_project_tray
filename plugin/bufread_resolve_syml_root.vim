" 2017-12-12: A .trustme.sh script is writing its log to the wrong file
" because of what Vim considers the current working directory. I should
" probably fix this in the Bash script, but I can also keep Vim's `cwd`
" up to date with the window's buffer's file's project directory.

      " 2017-12-20: What the what?!! For the past week (since I
      " added this code 2017-12-12), some files (especially
      " .vimprojects) throw errors when I try to blandly save, e.g.,
      "     E13: File exists (use ! to override)
      " which I tracked down to calling :file -- and it happens
      " whether I `execute` or call it directly. And even more
      " bizarrely, it happens even though this block of code does
      " not execute! And even more mind blowingly confusingly, it
      " does not happen if I if-0 the block of code! So we'll just,
      " well, leave this code here as a testament to how much I love
      " Vim but also how quirky it can be sometimes. (Actually, not
      " too quirky; I cannot think of another Vim'ism like this.)

      "     E95: Buffer with this name already exists
