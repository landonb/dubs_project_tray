" 2017-11-02: % of current win to use for new win on 'o', 'v', and H/Vexplore.

" 2020-03-19: Ha! I've only recently started using a split explorer,
" and immediately ran into big problem: netrw does not resolve symlink
" path correctly -- symlinks to files not in the same directory as the
" symlink had incorrect paths. But seems to be tree-view specific!
" - AVOID: let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
"   Follow: "Netrw fails to open symlinks in tree mode #2386"
"   Opened 2017-11-28 (not by me!) and still open 2020-03-19.
"     https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2386
" - Set the netrw lifestyle, er, liststyle to 'thin' or 'long' listings.
"   Opts- 'thin', one-file-per-line (0); long (1); wide (2); and tree (3).
"   - I tried long, but the tabstops do not align, so the details column,
"     well, it's not a column. Everything looks messy.
